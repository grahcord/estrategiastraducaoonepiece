Wealth, Fame, Power.
The man who had acquired everything in this world, the Pirate King, Gold Roger.
The final words that were said at his execution, sent people to the seas.
“My wealth and treasures?”
“If you want it, I’ll let you have it.”
“Look for it, I left all of it at that place!”
Men now, chasing their dreams, head towards the Grand Line.
The world now enters a Great Age of Pirates!
Gathering together all our dreams.
We’ll find the things that we’re looking for.
Things like a compass are just a source of delay.
We’ll heat it up and take the helm.
Even a dusty treasure map,
Is not a legend if it has been proven!
For a personal storm you just have to
ride on someone’s biorhythm!
It’s alright to think about it!
By gathering all the dreams,
We’ll find the things that we’re looking for.
A pocket of coins,
and you wanna be my friend?
We are, We are on the cruise!
We are!
Wow…
Huh?
I’m Luffy! The man who will become the Pirate King!
Please don’t be concerned.
A whirlpool like that won’t affect this ship.
Miss,
may I have the honor of this dance?
Alright!
Aww, missed again!
Batter out!
What are you doing?
You guys suck.
It’s really heavy…
It’s a wine barrel…
Must have a lot.
Let’s keep it.
Trouble to the starboard!
There’s a pirate flag on top of the mast!
A pirate ship!
Enemy attack! Enemy attack!
Captain! Pirates!
What?!
Everyone, please calm down!
Please calm down!
Please follow my instructions calmly!
Fire!
Coby!
H… hai.
Who’s the most beautiful woman in this ocean?
It's the captain of this ship of course, Alvida-sama.
Well said.
Thank you very much!
Alvida-sama, it has been a while hasn’t it?
Indeed! Now pull alongside the ship!
Men! Show them the power of Alvida, the female iron club pirate!
Coby! What are you doing?
I… I’m not used to this…
You dare talk back to me?
Please, anything but the iron club!
Then hurry up and get going!
We’re not going to kill you…
But we’re going to take everything of value.
Anyone who resists will be thrown into the ocean!
Hello?
There’s no one here, right…
Thank goodness…
That’s a pretty big barrel.
Who are you? I’ve never seen you before.
Hey you coward! Are you hiding and doing nothing again?
Not at all! I was pushing this wine barrel…
We’ll help lighten your load.
We're thirsty.
No way! If Alvida-sama finds out,
you’ll be killed.
It’ll be fine if you keep your mouth shut.
Right, Coby?
Yeah, that’s true…
It's pretty heavy…
Can’t wait!
Don't be so greedy. I’m going to smash it open right now.
WHAT A GREAT NAAAAP!
What the?
Who are you guys?
WHO THE HELL ARE YOU?!
He’ll catch a cold if he sleeps here.
It's your fault!
You bastard.
Stop screwing around. Don’t you know we’re pirates?!
I’m really hungry, got any…
Listen to what I’m saying!
You brat!
DIE!
What are you doing all of a sudden?
W… who are you?
Me? I’m Monkey D. Luffy. Nice to meet you!
What… what just happened?
What’s with them?
Hurry up and run!
When they come back with their friends, you’ll be killed!
Even so, I’m hungry.
How can you say that so calmly?!
There’s lots of pirates on the deck!
Don't go that way.
Wait! You're going the wrong way!
Food! Food! Food! Alright!
"They might not find us in here. Food! Banzai! Food! Wai! Wai!"
Which one should I pick?
This box? Oh, I’m right! It looks so good!
I'm Coby, and you’re Luffy-san, right?
That was amazing back there. How’d you do that?
These are good!
Is this a pirate ship?
No… this ship isn’t.
This ship is being attacked by Alvida-sama right now.
Mmm…? It doesn’t really matter.
Are there any boats on this ship?
There should be, but…
My ship got sucked into the whirlpool.
Eh, that whirlpool? You should be dead.
Yeah, I was really surprised by it.
Are you a pirate as well?
That was… a fateful day.
That day, I went aboard, intending to go fishing…
But it turned out that boat
was going to a pirate ship!
For the past two years,
I’ve been working like a slave so they wouldn’t kill me.
You're a freaking idiot!
How can you say that?
You can run away!
That's impossible! Impossible, impossible!
When I think about Alvida-sama finding out, my legs shake and I get really scared…
Ohh, you are a coward.
I don’t like you.
Get going! Move everything before the Marines get here!
Anyone who slacks off will meet my iron club!
Hurry up.
Look at all the treasure!
Hey, if you daydream, you’re going to get the iron club!
That’d be bad.
There's no way I can stand a blow from that.
Alvida-sama!
There's a problem.
What is it? You're so noisy.
The barrel was…
A monster!
Who’s a monster?
That’s not it… a weird person came out of a barrel…
He might be a bounty hunter.
What?
You're right.
Completely right… if I’m only brave enough to drift in the ocean in a barrel,
there’s something I want to do…
Luffy-san, what were you doing drifting in the ocean in a barrel?
I'm going to be the Pirate King!
P… P… Pirate King?
Yeah.
Seriously?
Seriously.
That means Luffy-san is a pirate?
Right.
Your crew?
Don't have any, looking for one now.
A Pirate King is someone who has everything in this world!
Wealth, fame and power all united within one person.
Meaning, you are going after “One Piece”.
Ah.
“Ah" you say?!
All the pirates in the world are going after that treasure!
I am too!
Impossible. impossible, impossible, impossible, absolutely impossible!
It would be impossible to stand on top in this great pirate era!
It can’t be done, impossible impossible!
Why did you hit me?
Just because.
It's fine, I’m used to it anyways.
It's not if it’s possible or not.
I do it because I want to.
f the Pirate King.
I don't care if I die fighting for it.
Not that I’m full, maybe I should go get a boat.
Maybe they’ll give me one if I ask…
If they’re good people.
I've never thought of that.
Can I do that too?
Not afraid to die.
What?
Maybe I can join the Marines.
Marines?
That’s right! It’s my dream to catch bad guys!
It’s been my dream ever since my childhood.
Can I do it?
How would I know?!
No, I will do it!
I'm going to get out of here and stop working as a slave for Alvida-sama!
No, I will catch Alvida!
Making a friend like this…
Who are you going to catch…
Eh, Coby!
You're not the pirate hunter Zoro.
Zoro?
Coby!
Who’s the most beautiful woman in this ocean?
That is of course…
Who’s this fat lady?
Fat? Now he’s done it…
BRAT!!!
Let’s go!
You!
It’s not fair to attack from behind!
It's not fair to attack with more people!
Just kidding!
GOMU GOMU NO…
ROCKET!
What?
Luffy-san, what are you?
Me? I’m a rubber man.
Rubber man… that…
You ate the devil’s fruit right?
Yeah, I ate the rubber fruit.
Is that so.
I've heard rumors about it, but I never thought it really existed.
You also have some moves… Are you a bounty hunter?
I'm a pirate.
Pirate? Just you?
It’s just me right now, but I’ll find a crew eventually.
Let’s see… I think about 10 people sound right.
I see, so you are a pirate.
That makes us enemies doesn’t it?
Lu… Luffy-san, run.
Why?
You saw the power of that iron club didn’t you?
This person is the stron…
I’ve decided to become the Pirate King.
I don't care if I die fighting of rit.
The number one what?
Num… num… num…
Number one stinking ugly old hag!
What did you say?
I will join the Marines! Join and fight pirates like you!
Do you even know what you are saying?!
I know!
I’ll… I’ll do what I want!
Join the Marines and… join the Marines and…
Capture you!!
Little brat!
No regrets!
No regrets!
I said it! I fought for my dream!
Well said!
Doesn’t hurt.
What?
Because I’m rubber.
GOMU GOMU NO…
PISTOL!
The sky is so blue…
Hey!
Yes!
Give Coby a boat.
He’s going to join the Marines.
Let him go.
Yes, yes!
Luffy-san.
That’s the… Marines!
Isn’t that great? Why don’t you go?
I’m a pirate, time to run!
How can I… They’d arrest me before I could join!
We got away somehow…
That was fun!
Um, Luffy-san.
If One Piece is your goal, that means you are heading toward the Grand Line right?
It's also called the graveyard of pirates.
Yeah, that’s why I need a strong crew.
That pirate hunter… what kind of a guy is he?
You mean Zoro?
I heard that he was captured by the Marines.
What? He’s weak then.
Not at all! He’s a terrifying beast!
Why are you asking me this?
If he was a good guy, I thought I’d make him part of my crew.
You’re going to do something reckless again.
He might be a good guy.
He’s been caught because he’s a bad guy!
It’s impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible, impossible…
Absolutely impos…
Why did you hit me?
Just because!
In childhood, I always followed
the treasure map in my mind.
Lead me to the promised land I sought
that I might not lose to one unknown.
My true..
dream has yet to be fufilled.
But if the world changes,
you could take me from when I know nothing.
Take me with you, so my memories won’t fade.
