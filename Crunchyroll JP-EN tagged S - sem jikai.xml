		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Which should I <S1>choose?</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>This box?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Ooh, jackpot!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		These look <S1>great!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>M-My name is Coby.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>You're Luffy-san, right?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		That was <S1>incredible</S1> just now!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>How did you do that?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S6>These things</S6> are <S1>great!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Is this a pirate ship?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		No <S10></S10>, <S7>it's a passenger ship that's being <S1>raided</S1> by Alvida-sama.</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Well, it doesn't matter.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S2><S6>Do you know if there are any boats onboard</S6>?</S2>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I-I think so...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>My ship got swallowed by this giant whirlpool...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>You mean</S8> that <S6>whirlpool?!</S6>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8><S2>No one could survive that!</S2></S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7><S8>Boy, was that a real surprise!</S8></S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Are you <S1>one</S1> of those pirates, too?
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>It was on that fateful day...</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>That day, I got in a boat on the outskirts of town to go fishing... but it turned out the boat was actually headed for a pirate ship.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>It's been two years since...</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S2>In exchange for my life</S2>, <S8>I've been forced to be a chore boy.</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Man, you're dumb and stupid!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S9>You're brutally honest...</S9>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>If you don't like it, then run away!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>I-I can't!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>Just the thought of Alvida-sama finding me... ...frightens me and makes me weak in the knees--</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S2>Oh, you're a wimp, too?</S2>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Man, I hate you!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Hey, now!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Quit dawdling!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Haul it all off before the navy <S6>gets here!</S6>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S9><S7>Anyone caught dawdling gets a taste of my iron club!</S7></S9>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>What a haul!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>--Seems like a pretty rich ship!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Hey!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>You'll get the club if she catches you</S7> <S1>slackin' off!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>Oh, whoops!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Yeah, one hit from that and you're a goner!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Alvida-sama!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0></S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>It's bad!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>What is it?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>You're annoying me!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>A b-b-barrel!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>M-M-Monster!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Huh?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Who're you calling a monster?!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>N-No...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7><S1>Some weird guy popped out</S1> of a barrel...</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>He might be... a bounty hunter...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>What?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>Yeah...</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>That's right...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		If only I had the courage to drift the <S1>ocean</S1> in a barrel... ...there's actually something I want to do, too...
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Umm...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>What compelled you</S1> to set out onto the sea, Luffy-san?
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I'm gonna be the <S7>King of the Pirates!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>--K-K-King of the Pirates?!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>--Yep.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>--Are you serious?!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>—Yeah.</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Wait</S8>, you're a pirate, Luffy-san?!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Yep.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>What about your crew?!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Don't got one.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'm just about to look for one.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>K-K-King of the Pirates</S7> is the title given to the person... ...who obtains everything in this world!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S10>That means seeking the great treasure of wealth, fame, and power... ...the One Piece!</S10>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Yup!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Yup?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Pirates all over the world <S1>are after</S1> that treasure!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Me too!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way, no way, no way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Absolutely no way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		There's no way you can stand at <S1>the apex</S1> of this Great Pirate Era!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Why did you hit me?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Just because.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>But it's all right.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'm used to it now...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>It's not about whether I can or not.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I'm gonna <S1>do it</S1> because I want to.
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I've decided to be the <S7>King of the Pirates</S7>, so if I die fighting for that, that's fine with me!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Now, then!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>My belly's full-- guess I'll go get me a boat!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I wonder if they'll give me one if I ask.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Hopefully they're generous.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I never once thought about it...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Do you suppose I can do it, too?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>If I'm prepared to die for it?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Do what?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Do you think... even I could join the navy?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Navy?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>Yes!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>Catching bad guys is my dream!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>It's been my dream ever since I was little!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Do you think I can do it?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>How should I know?</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>No!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'll do it!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>If I'm gonna be a chore boy for the rest of my life, I'll break out of here and catch even Alvida-sama-- no, Alvida!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>You're gonna team up with him to catch who?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Huh, Coby?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0></S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>You don't seem to be Zoro, the pirate hunter.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Zoro?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Coby!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Who's the most beautiful <S1>of all</S1> on these seas?!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>O-Of course that would be--</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Who's this <S6>big chunky</S6> lady?
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>—Chunky?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>--Not good...</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>You runt!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Let’s go!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S10>Why, you...</S10>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0></S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Whoops!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7><S2>It's not fair</S2> to attack from behind!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7><S2>It's not fair</S2> to attack all at once!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S10>Gotcha!</S10>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Gum-Gum... ...Rocket!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>What?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>L-Luffy-san... What are you?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Me?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'm a rubber person!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>A rubber person?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>You can't be serious!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>You've eaten a Devil's Fruit, haven't you?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Yeah!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>The Gum-Gum Fruit!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>I see!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I'd heard the rumors, <S8>but I guess they really do exist!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S9>You also seem pretty skilled.</S9>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>You a bounty hunter?</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'm a pirate!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>A pirate?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Hah!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>All by yourself?!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		It's just me right now, but I'll find some more <S6>sooner or later!</S6>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Yeah...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Ten crewmen sounds good to me!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Ah, so you're a pirate too, huh?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Then that means you and me are enemies, huh?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>--L-Luffy-san!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Let's get out of here!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>—Why?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S10>You saw how powerful her club is!</S10>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7><S1>In these waters</S1>, she's the <S6>most--</S6></S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I've decided to be the <S7>King of the Pirates</S7>, so if I die fighting for that, that's fine with me!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'm the most what?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		T-T-The... The most ugly, <S10></S10> <S6>cragged old hag</S6> ever!
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>What did you say?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I... I'm going to join the navy!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		And then I'm gonna beat up <S6>pirates!</S6>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Do you even know what you're saying?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I do!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I'm gonna do what I want to do!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I'm gonna... I'm gonna join the navy... <S9>...and catch your lousy ass!</S9>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		You <S6>damn pipsqueak!</S6>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>No regrets!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>No regrets!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>I said it!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>I fought!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S7>For my dream!</S7>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Well said!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0></S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>That doesn't work!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>What?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Cause I'm rubber!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Gum-Gum... ...Pistol!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>The sky is so blue...</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Hey!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>—Yes?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>--Yes?!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Give Coby a <S6>small boat!</S6>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>He's gonna join the navy!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Keep your mouths shut and let him go!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>—R-Right!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>--R-Right!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Luffy-san!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>It's the navy!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Oh, perfect timing!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>You should go see 'em!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>But I'm a pirate!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>I'm outta here!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Get serious!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>I can't just join the navy like this!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>I'll be captured instead!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Looks like we <S1>managed to</S1> get away...
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Whew, that was fun!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Umm, Luffy-san.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0></S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>If you're heading for the One Piece, --that means you're going to the Grand Line, right?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>—Yeah.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		That place is also <S1>referred to</S1> as a pirate graveyard, you know.
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Yeah.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>That's why I need a strong crew.</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>What about that pirate hunter guy?</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>What's he like?</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>You mean Zoro?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		I heard he's <S4>being held prisoner</S4> at a navy base.
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Aw, he's a weakling?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S1>Nothing of the sort!</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>He's as terrifying as a demon!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		Why are you asking <S1>about him?</S1>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0></S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Thought I might have him join my crew if he's a good guy!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>You're being reckless again!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>C'mon, he might be a good guy!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>He's been caught because he's a bad guy!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>No way, no way, no way!</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S8>Absolutely no--</S8>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Why did you hit me?</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>Just because!</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S10>"To be continued"</S10>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>When I was little, I had a vision of a treasure map and I always searched for that miraculous place before someone else could beat me to it</S0>
		</SENTENCE>
		<SENTENCE>
		<S0>If the world is going to change before I can even attain my dream then take me to the time when I knew nothing so that my memories won't fade</S0>
